This repository is the test bed for a STEGO-based Hypershell variant.

STEGO must provide common service infrastructure and generated contracts.
Hypershell must supply its unique business rules and application workflows
through explicit extension points. No STEGO component may depend on a Hypershell
entity name or application rule.

The variant is not implemented yet. The initial commit records the reference
REST and gRPC contracts under `contracts/reference/`. `contracts/upstream.json`
records their source revision and SHA-256 hashes. These files are acceptance
inputs, not generated implementation. The source is Apache-2.0 licensed; see
`LICENSE`.

The compatibility target includes:

| Area | Required behavior |
| --- | --- |
| REST | Resource fields, paths, methods, pagination, search, errors, and field visibility |
| gRPC | Messages, service methods, watch streams, and authorization parity |
| Security | OIDC verification, platform roles, resource ownership, filtered lists, and opaque denied reads |
| Storage | PostgreSQL constraints, atomic owner grants, concurrency, and explicit migrations |
| Events | Committed resource events, delete events, reconnect, and bounded delivery |
| Service accounts | Creator ownership, role limits, lifecycle, secret handling, and provisioning |
| Control plane | Gateway, cluster, database, network, and release reconciliation |
| Clients | SDKs, CLI commands, web workflows, and authentication |
| Operations | Health, readiness, metrics, tracing, limits, shutdown, and deployment checks |

Compiler correctness and reusable infrastructure changes belong in STEGO.
Behavioral acceptance tests and Hypershell domain code belong here. Passing
compilation alone does not establish compatibility or production readiness.

Run `go test ./...` to verify the source hashes, validate OpenAPI references, and
compile the protobuf contracts. The checks cover 37 REST operations, 41 gRPC
methods, and six server watch streams. They also check gateway field ownership,
reserved wire numbers, and the restriction on returning service-account secrets.
Run `go run ./cmd/contracts` to print the operation inventory as JSON. Contract
resolution uses embedded files and cannot fetch remote schemas.

These tests validate the reference inputs. They do not test an implemented
Hypershell service. The CI workflow runs them with the Go race detector.
